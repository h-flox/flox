class FlightEventEnum(EventEnum):
    """
    Parent class of events specific to launching federations in Flight.

    This is the parent class of the following child classes:

    - [`CoordinatorEvents`][flight.events.CoordinatorEvents]
    - [`AggregatorEvents`][flight.events.AggregatorEvents]
    - [`WorkerEvents`][flight.events.WorkerEvents]

    This class simply extends the [`EventEnum`](https://pytorch.org/ignite/generated/ignite.engine.events.EventEnum.html#ignite.engine.events.EventEnum)
    class provided by PyTorch-Ignite. The only difference between
    `FlightEventEnum` and Ignite's `EventEnum` is that instances of a
    `FlightEventEnum` can only be equal if they are of the same class.
    For instance:

    ```python
    >>> from flight.events import *
    >>> e1 = CoordinatorEvents.STARTED
    >>> e2 = WorkerEvents.STARTED
    >>> e1 == e2
    False
    ```

    In the above example, if `CoordinatorEvents`, `AggregatorEvents`,
    and `WorkerEvents` had only extended Ignite's `EventEnum`, then
    `e1 == e2` would evaluate to `True`, which is not useful for Flight.
    We want to discern between events belonging to these classes, even if
    they share the same nameâ€”which is done for simplicity.
