# Welcome to Flight

### Getting Started

**Flight** (**F**ederated **L**earning **I**n **G**eneralized **H**ierarchical **T**
opologies)
is a simple, highly customizable, and easy-to-deploy framework for launching Federated
Learning processes across
a decentralized network. It is designed to simulate FL workflows while also making it
trivially easy to deploy them on
real-world devices (e.g., Internet-of-Things and edge devices). Built on top of _Globus
Compute_ (formerly known as
_funcX_), Flight is designed to run on anything that can be started as a Globus Compute
Endpoint.

### What can Flight do?

Flight is supports several state-of-the-art approaches for FL processes, including
hierarchical and asynchronous FL.

|                  |      2-tier      |  Hierarhchical   |
|-----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
|  **Synchronous** | :material-check: | :material-check: |
| **Asynchronous** | :material-check: | :material-close: |

#### Installation

The package can be found on pypi:

```bash
pip install py-flight
```

#### Usage

Flight is a simple, highly-customizable, and easy-to-deploy framework for hierarchical,
multi-tier federated learning
systems built on top of the Globus Compute platform.

```python title="Basic Flight Example" linenums="1"
from v1.flight import Topology, federated_fit
from torch import nn


class MyModule(nn.Module):
    ...


topo = Topology.from_yaml("my-topo.yaml")
federated_fit(
    module=MyModule(),
    topo=topo,
    strategy="fedavg",
    strategy_params={"participation_frac": 0.5},
    where="local",
    logger="csv",
    log_out="my_results.csv"
)
```
