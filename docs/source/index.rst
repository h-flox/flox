Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FLoX is a simple, highly customizable, and easy-to-deploy framework for launching Federated Learning processes across a
decentralized network. It is designed to simulate FL workflows while also making it trivially easy to deploy them on
real-world devices (e.g., Internet-of-Things and edge devices). Built on top of **Globus Compute** (formerly known as
*funcX*, FLoX is designed to run on anything that can be started as a Globus Compute Endpoint.

What can FLoX do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FLoX is supports several state-of-the-art approaches for FL processes, including hierarchical and asynchronous FL.
