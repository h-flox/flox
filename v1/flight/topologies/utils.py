    """
    Constructs a hierarchical topology.

    This is a flexible function that allows users to rapidly produce hierarchical
    `Topology` object by setting the number of works (`n`) and the shape of
    intermediate aggregators (`aggr_shape`). The `aggr_shape` argument is a
    `typing.Sequence` of integers in *ascending order* that defines the layers of
    intermediate aggregators in the resulting `Topology`.

    For instance consider `aggr_shape=[2, 4]` and `n=10`. These arguments will
    result in a topology with a single coordinator with connections to `2`
    aggregators, these `2` aggregators will have random connections covering `4`
    aggregators, and these `4` aggregators will have random connections covering
    `10` workers.

    This results in a topology similar to the following:

    ```mermaid
    flowchart

        coord-->a-1.1
        coord-->a-1.2

        a-1.1-->a-2.1

        a-2.4-->w-8
        a-2.4-->w-9
        a-2.4-->w-10
    ```

    Args:
        n (int): The number of worker nodes.
        aggr_shape (typing.Sequence[int] | None): The shape of intermediate aggregator
            layers. If this argument is `None`, then `flat_topology` is called with `n`.
        rng (numpy.random.Generator | int | None): Random generator for repeatability.
            This argument can be a generator (`numpy.random.Generator`),
            a random seed (`int`) or pseudorandom (`None`).

    Returns:
        A hierarchical `Topology` instance.

    Notes:
        This function behaves randomly in terms of how the nodes are connected
        in a `Topology`. Be mindful of this. To ensure reproducibility, take
        advantage of the `rng` argument.

    Creates a `Topology`` with a balanced tree topology with a (roughly) fixed number
    of leaves (i.e., workers).

    By default, `networkx` provides the `balanced_tree` function which generates a
    balanced tree using the branching factor and the height of the tree. This function
    wraps that function and computes the branching factor using
    $b = \lfloor l^{1/h} \rfloor where $l$ is the number of leaves and $h$ is the
    height.

    Args:
        leaves (int): Approximate number of leaves in the resulting tree (see note).
        height (int): Height of the tree.
        rounding (t.Literal): How to round the branching factor.

    Returns:
        The `Topology` instance with the constructed, balanced tree.

    Notes:
        Because the calculation for $b$ (described above) is not always going to result
        in an integer, this function will use the floor of $l^{1/h}$. Unless you are
        wise about your parameters for `leaves` and `height`, you will have more
        leaves than originally specified. So, be mindful of this.

        It is worth being mindful of the values used for the `height` and `leaves`
        arguments. Multiples of two are more reliable. It is common to result in
        having many more leaves than you might specify. So be mindful of this when
        using this function.
