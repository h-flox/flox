    A ``Strategy`` in FLoX is used to implement the logic of an FL process. A ``Strategy`` provides
    a number of callbacks which can be overridden to inject pieces of logic throughout the FL process.
    Some of these callbacks are run on the aggregator nodes while others are run on the worker nodes.

    It is _**highly**_ encouraged that you read [What Do Strategies Do](/getting_started/strategies/what/)
