### Getting Started
FLoX is a simple, highly customizable, and easy-to-deploy framework for launching Federated Learning processes across a 
decentralized network. It is designed to simulate FL workflows while also making it trivially easy to deploy them on 
real-world devices (e.g., Internet-of-Things and edge devices). Built on top of _Globus Compute_ (formerly known as 
_funcX_), FLoX is designed to run on anything that can be started as a Globus Compute Endpoint.  


### What can FLoX do?

FLoX is supports several state-of-the-art approaches for FL processes, including hierarchical and asynchronous FL. 

|     | 2-tier         | Hierarhchical         |
| --- |----------------|-----------------------|
| **Synchronous**| :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark:    |
| **Asynchronous** | :white_check_mark:            | :x:                   |

#### Installation

The package can be found on pypi:

```bash
pip install pyflox
```

#### Usage

FLoX is a simple, highly-customizable, and easy-to-deploy framework for hierarchical, multi-tier federated learning
systems built on top of the Globus Compute platform.

```python title="Basic FLoX Example" linenums="1"
from flox import Flock, federated_fit
from torch import nn


class MyModule(nn.Module):
    ...


flock = Flock.from_yaml("my_flock.yaml")
federated_fit(
    module=MyModule(),
    flock=flock,
    strategy="fedavg",
    strategy_params={"participation_frac": 0.5},
    where="local",
    logger="csv",
    log_out="my_results.csv"
)
```
