class FedProx(Strategy):
    """Implementation of FedAvg with Proximal Term.

    This strategy extends ``FedAvg`` and differs from it by computing a "proximal term"
    and adding it to the computed loss during the training step before doing backpropagation.
    This proximal term is the norm difference between the parameters of the global model
    and the worker's locally-updated model. This proximal term is used to make aggregation
    less sensitive to harshly heterogeneous (i.e., non-iid) data distributions across workers.

    More information on the proximal term and its definition can be found in the docstring
    for ``FedProx.wrk_after_train_step()`` and in the reference below.
